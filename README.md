# GeoLocation

This was the 21st project from the #JavaScript30 that i've completed. I built a GeoLocation based Speedometer and Compass but instead of hosting it on my own server I had to host it on an emulator on Xcode. 
This app is kind of like a compass, except we used another person's location and speed. It shows which location the person is going in and the speed that they're going(KMH)

Things I learned:

-Xcode

Goals:

-Make mobile responsive
